# COMP3000
## SpheroAI
Supervisor: Thomas Wennekers
Project Vision: 
This project aims to develop an autonomous road navigation system powered by deep reinforcement learning. Our goal is to showcase the practical implementation of AI in real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of autonomous driving. The project will use computer vision to watch the real-life events and use reinforcement learning to move the physical agent. The goal of the project is to educate students interested in AI and STEM who are struggling with understanding the concepts because they are visual learners. The project will include a website that demonstrates how a neural network is trained via reinforcement learning, this is also how the user will see what the neural network sees
